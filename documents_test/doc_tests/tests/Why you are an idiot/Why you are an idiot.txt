The whole paradigm of opposition between Conservative and Liberal is nothing but journalistic drivel anyway. 

All serious intellectuals are concerned with is the truth.

The nonsensical binary division of opinion whereby two opposing camps of so-called 'Conservatives' and 'Liberals' are formed in regard to any and every issue is an utterly infantile and pointless conception outside of the mundane brains of the shallowest modern political commentators and the most illiterate and ignorant Youtube comments.

Real hard thinkers devote very little of their time to such inanity, apart from whenever they feel obliged to point it out, particularly in regard to the role it plays in maintaining the status quo by providing an illusion of alternatives.

Both the terms, 'Conservative' and 'Liberal,' and the concepts to which they refer, have essentially been misunderstood and misapplied to such an extent as to have lost almost entirely their intellectual value or relevance.

You would have to laboriously scrape away immense amounts of sentimental dross to get to any real intellectual substance they might retain, and doing so would no doubt wholly dissolve their ridiculous opposition in contemporary political discourse.

People who buy into that brainless conflict are very rarely anything more than unconscious zombies capable of doing little else but fanatically parrot their preferred organs of propaganda.
