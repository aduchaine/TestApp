	Installation:

		The only installation option currently available is "default". The program will not work if directories are changed.
		
		Default:
	
			Download the zip file.
			
			If the download path (directory) has ANY spaces in it, move the zip file to a location which doesn't have spaces. Underscores are okay.
			
			Unpack/unzip the zip file. Do not create a folder for the unpacked files. A directory with files is created when unzipped.
	
			Navigate into the folder "..\TheProgram\" created by unzipping the previous file.
			
			Click/start the item which says "Click Me".
			
			This will unpack all files, including the main program, create a base directory for the program and place all files into these directories. This includes the original download and anything else which was unzipped with it.		
			
			You can find everything in the base directory:	"C:\MyProgram"
			
			The program is ready to use.	
	
	
	Initial_Startup:
	
		In "C:\MyProgram" you will find a folder with the program and all necessary files along with a shortcut you can place anywhere.
		
		You can use the shortcut to start the program or click it directly in "C:\MyProgram\TestApp\".
		
		When the program starts for the first time, it will begin by creating "C:\MyProgram\Documents", "C:\MyProgram\Logs" and "C:\MyProgram\DataFiles" folders.
		
		The final result of the program, which occurs when a user completes the content, will go into the "C:\MyProgram\Documents\" folder.
		
		"C:\MyProgram\DataFiles" is for menu and list items. These individual lists are can be made custom.
		
		User and error logs will go into the "C:\MyProgram\Logs\" folder.

		
	Using_the_Program:
	
		The program will start like any other program.
		
		To terminate the session before completion, click the "Quit" button or close/"X" the window. The program's internal memory is destroy when terminated regardless of how this is done.
		
		The only way to receive output is to complete all the steps.
	
	
		Default_Settings:
			
			The program is set up to identify user input and do something with it. Certain user input will not output text directly to the user. The standard function keys like, ENTER/RETURN, TAB, ESC, etc. behave in a specific manner. It's intentional to try to adhere to the most common conventions of use for this type of input.
			
			Accepting a selection will save the input to the program's internal memory. If the program is exited before finishing, all memory is destroyed.
			
			In most circumstances, navigating back with unfinished input fields on the current page, will save any input before performing the navigation command. This is to save time on re-entering the input if reviewing previous pages is desired.
			
			Navigating forward is only possible if the input fields contain valid input.
			
			The virtual keyboard will be the primary text input device if the option is accepted at the beginning of the program. (this is not the case - it's only available for use on the "name" page, currently)
			
			Keys_or_equivalents:
			
				If a description states "standard", it is assumed to perform the most conventional operation.
				
				Function keys not listed below will have no effect.
				
				"ENTER/RETURN" - accepts a selection; this also hides the virtual keyboard if used
				
				"TAB" - inter-page navigation; pressing TAB will go to the next input field if possible; single question pages require an explicit selection and TAB is not enabled
				
				Arrows:				
					"LEFT/RIGHT" - results vary
				
						Page: accepts any user input; navigation to the next or previous page; if the page has insufficient user input, navigation forward will not be possible
					
						Text fields: standard cursor navigation to the next/previous cursor position
						
					"UP/DOWN" - only menus; moves the selector; pressing ENTER accepts the selection					
					
				Virtual_keyboard:				
					
					Some of the commands are described above. The few below are specific to the virtual keyboard. The default layout is the lowercase alphabet, some standard functions and a few special characters. Starting the keyboard or switching from the numeric view will revert to the default layout regardless of the previous state.
					
					"&123/ABC" - toggles between numbers-special characters and default layout
					
					"ESC" - hides the keyboard; this will also accept any user input similar to pressing ENTER and only while using the virtual keyboard
					
					"BACKSPACE/SHIFT" - standard
					
					"FCT2/FCT3" - undefined
					
			Mouse_clicks_or_equivalents:
			
				Right Click: does nothing
				
				Mouse Wheel: scrolls menus; does not move the selector with it, you must click your selection
				
				Left Click: accepts a selection
				
				
		I'll add more later...
